# "Life Savers"    
This is a GitHub repository containing scripts, code, and tools that help me save time in my daily life. The contents of this repo range from simple calculations, like determining meal prep portions, to automation scripts and utilities that streamline my projects.

1. Meal Prep Calculator 
- Purpose: I cook in large batches and often found myself repeatedly doing manual calculations while portioning meals for the week. To simplify this process, I created a script to automate the math.

### How It Works:

- The script takes two inputs: the total weight (in grams) of the cooked food and the desired portion size per serving.   
- It calculates the number of guaranteed servings, ensuring that you donâ€™t accidentally over-portion and run out of fresh meals too soon
